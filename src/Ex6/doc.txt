You first argued that the article is bad because there are more important things going on in Ukraine than the challenges of a nature reserve during war time; namely Russia's attempt to conquer Ukraine and add it to the Russian empire. After having it pointed out to you that literally no one thinks that this is the most important thing going in Ukraine, you changed your objection to instead be that the problem with the article is that it makes Russia look bad to have an article about the challenges of running a nature reserve during a war.

Did I accurately capture your objections to the article?
